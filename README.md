## What this Project aims to be

**This repository aims to be a boilerplate for a modular and modern (v4) Sinatra app.**

There used to be a demo on heroku, but heroku is no more (free of charge at least) ü™¶

## <a name="why"></a>Why not Rails?

Sinatra is a ruby/rack framework, that can be used as an alternative where Rails would simply be an overkill.

I started working my way through the sinatra docs, aiming for a setup that can easily be modeled to a basic use case.

> Have you tried Roda, Sequel and Rodauth?  

Yes! And I totally use that setup whenever possible (November 2021) and you should try at least roda as a POC üòé I am 100 % serious! There's nothing wrong with sinatra, but roda kills it. The journey will undoubtedly make you a better (ruby) programmer.

## <a name="what"></a>What is in?

I want this Sinatra boilerplate app to:

* work with Bundler
* use ActiveRecord as ORM
* have an MVC-like structure
* support Sass/Scss and CoffeeScript
* party with [jQuery](http://jquery.com) and [Turbolinks](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks)! Yes, Turbolinks.
* rolls with a very basic bcrypt/warden based Authentication System
* use PostgresQL as Database
* run on heroku (don't forget: `$ heroku config:add APP_ENV=production`)

## <a name="start"></a>Get started
You need **Ruby (>= 3.2)** and **Bundler** (of course).

* `$ git clone`
* `$ bundle install`
* edit __config/database.yml__
* set `SESSION_SECRET` environment variable (see `.env.example`)
* `$ rake db:setup`
* `$ bundle exec puma` or `rerun rackup` ([rerun](https://github.com/alexch/rerun) gem - _not included by default!_)
* visit `localhost:9292` in your browser
* edit titles in __views/layout.erb__ and __views/nav.erb__
* check/set timezone __config/timezone.rb__

### now what?
* read the credits
* read the code
* run the code, see what it does
* delete what you don't need and built from there, should a barebone branch be offered? What do you think? :grin:

Most code is commented, so you'll learn what it does.

### What needs to be done
* enable flash messages, especially for validation feedback

## Contribute
* Send in pull requests, improve this project with features or **simply by adding/improving comments** :grin:
* Be nice, make public forks
* What did you use this app for? Please, let me know! Share your projects.
